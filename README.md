Accompanist is a group of libraries that aim to supplement [Jetpack Compose][compose] with features that are commonly required by developers but not yet available. This version is meant to port some of the Accompanist libraries to Compose Multiplatform, so it can be used on the Jvm and Android.

**Current Library Compose Multiplatform Version: 1.2.0-alpha01-dev774**

**Current Library Jetpack Compose Version: 1.2.1**

Currently, Accompanist contains:
### ‚è≥ [Placeholder](./placeholder/)
A library that provides easy-to-use modifiers for displaying a placeholder UI while content is loading.

### üåä [Flow Layouts](./flowlayout/) (Soon to be deprecated - Upstreamed in Compose 1.4)
A library that adds Flexbox-like layout components to Jetpack Compose.

### ‚¨áÔ∏è [Swipe to Refresh](./swiperefresh/) (Deprecated)
See our [Migration Guide](https://google.github.io/accompanist/swiperefresh/) for migrating to PullRefresh in Compose Material.

### üìñ [Pager](./pager/) (Deprecated)
See our [Migration Guide](https://google.github.io/accompanist/pager/) for migrating to Pager in Compose.

---

## Future?

Any of the features available in this group of libraries may become obsolete in the future, at which point they will (probably) become deprecated. 

We will aim to provide a migration path (where possible), to whatever supersedes the functionality.

---

### Why the name?

The library is all about adding some utilities around Compose. Music composing is done by a
composer, and since this library is about supporting composition, the supporting role of an [accompanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accompaniment) felt like a good name.
